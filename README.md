My most interesting piece of code was the LocalDate class. Going into into this capstone, I had heard about it but it just seemed so cryptic to me. That is why I spent so much time during this capstone to learn it and even played around with it a little. I gave LocalDate.now() its own variable and used it in my code. This would allow me to pull up my current time using less characters.
